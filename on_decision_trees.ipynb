    "\n",
    "data points: 0, 1, 3, 4 (dep. var.: False, True, True, False)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Group 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "data points: 2 (dep. var.: False)\n",
    "\n",
    "While I've isolated one of the customers who haven't paid in the second group, the first group is an even mix of payers and non-payers. So this split is not particularly good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would a different question split our data more effectively? Let's try:\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Is the customer's salary less than $60k?\"\n",
